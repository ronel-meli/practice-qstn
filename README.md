# what it contains
This repo has my programs hand written but research was done and also referred to my previous class that is recursion.
i used .py in each file 
# i have 6 programs with its own functions to compute the question
i. the first one is to calculate the sum of numbers and used calculate_sum of numbers in a list
11. the second one is used to check if a number is odd or even by checking the modulus when divided by 2
iii. the third one is to calculate the factorial of a number using a lop but not recursive
iv.the fourth one is used to reverse a string by adding each character to the front of a new string
v. the fifth one is used to give the sum of digits in a number and hence i had to remove the lst digits and add to the total= o and extracts other remaining digits and the loop continues until the digits are all added
vi. the sixth one is used to find the factorial using the recursive, something i researched.
